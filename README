The prioq package declares a simple interface for a priority queue. It also provies a test suite to ensure implementations of the prioq.Q interface work as we expect.

This collection of priority queues were all experiments for the matching_engine project. They have been deleted from that project and not used, but were sufficiently interesting to be preserved. Does not compile :)
